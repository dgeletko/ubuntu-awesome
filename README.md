# ubuntu-awesome

Ansible provisioning scripts to transform a minimal Ubuntu server installation into a lightweight Ubuntu desktop
with the [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org) and basic applications for my personal laptop. The goal
is to try to eliminate the _bloat_ of a typical Ubuntu install (including the minimal install). Ubuntu packages
in general pull in a lot of unnecessary dependencies and care must be taken as a simple package install can easily
pull in the entire Gnome desktop, etc. The various Ubuntu seeds were used as the basis for defining the core
packages.
